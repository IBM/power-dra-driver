# Power Dynamic Resource Allocation Driver

This repository contains a Power Architecture dynamic resource allocation driver for use with the *Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)* feature of Kubernetes. The driver aligns with [KEP-4381: Dynamic Resource Allocation with Structured Parameters](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-node/4381-dra-structured-parameters/README.md) and assigns at most one device to one pod on the system.

The driver facilitates access to:

1. *Nest Accelerator unit (NX) compression and decompression co-processors*: NX is a non-core part of the Power processor, which provides a DEFLATE compliant (RFC1950, 1951, 1952) compression accelerator. This feature has a device driver in userspace `/dev/crypto/nx-gzip` which is shared among logical-partitions on the same systems, and by proxy containers in the logical partition. 

As additional features are made available, the driver is to be expanded.

This project is based on [dra-example-driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-example-driver). This project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.

## Pre-Requisites

On an OpenShift Container Platform cluster, one must enable the `DynamicResourceAllocation` `FeatureGate`. To setup, go into the Cluster UI, `Administration` -> `CustomResourceDefinitions` -> `FeatureGate` -> `Instances` -> `cluster` add `spec.featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade`

You must have Power10 or higher logical partitions that are part of your cluster. It will not allocate `/dev/crypto/nx-gzip` access. The system must have licensed the Power system feature `active_mem_expansion_capable`.

You should also be using an OpenShift Container Platform 4.19+.

## Kind cluster

To use the kind cluster in the power arch machine, run the script to create the kind cluster with single worker node.

``` shell
ARCH=arm64 make dev-setup
```

## Install

To install the code, use:

``` shell
helm install \
  --create-namespace \
  --namespace power-dra-driver \
  power-dra-driver \
  deployments/helm/power-dra-driver
```

## Upgrade

To install the code, use:

``` shell
helm upgrade \
  -n power-dra-driver \
  --namespace power-dra-driver \
  power-dra-driver \
  deployments/helm/power-dra-driver
```

## Uninstall

To uninstall the code, use:

``` shell
helm uninstall \
    power-dra-driver \
    -n power-dra-driver
```

## Delete the kind cluster

To delete the kind cluster created , run the script to delete it.

``` shell
ARCH=arm64 make dev-teardown
```

OpenShift Docs are specific to a use-case

This code repository is based on [kubernetes-sigs/dra-example-driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-example-driver) and extends APIs used in the example driver.

# Support

> Is this a Red Hat or IBM supported solution?

This solution is used to demonstrate accessing the co-processors part of the IBM Power systems. It is a demonstration at this time.
