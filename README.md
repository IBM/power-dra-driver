# Power Dynamic Resource Allocation Driver
This repository contains a Power Architecture resource driver for use with the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) feature of Kubernetes.

The driver facilitates access to:
1. Nest Accelerator unit (NX) are non-core components of the POWER processor chip including compression and encryption co-processors. One feature is nx-gzip, which is a DEFLATE compliant (RFC1950, 1951, 1952) compression accelerator in NX. This feature is a device driver in userspace `/dev/crypto/nx-gzip` which is shared among many LPARs and many containers. 

As additional features are made available, the driver will be expanded.

## Pre-Requisites

This feature uses DynamicResourceAllocation. To setup, go into the Cluster UI, `Administration` -> `CustomResourceDefinitions` -> `FeatureGate` -> `Instances` -> `cluster` add `spec.featureSet: TechPreviewNoUpgrade`

You must have Power10+ nodes to take advantage of the power-dra-driver. It will not allocate nx-gzip access if you are not on a Power10.

## Install

```
helm upgrade -i \
  --create-namespace \
  --namespace power-dra-driver \
  power-dra-driver \
  deployments/helm/power-dra-driver
```

## Uninstall

```
helm uninstall -i \
  --create-namespace \
  --namespace power-dra-driver \
  power-dra-driver \
  deployments/helm/power-dra-driver
```
